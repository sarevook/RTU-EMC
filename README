INTRODUCTION

pyTDMS is a light-weight, quick-and-dirty python library that can (mostly) read TDMS files. Not all data structures are implemented at this point, but reading measurement data stored as floats or ints should work seamlessly.


USAGE

Very simple. Example, in python:

import pyTDMS
(objects,rawdata) = pyTDMS.read("path/to/myfile.tdms")

This will read the given tdms file. It returns two data structures:
- objects: contains the metadata, in key-value pairs
- rawdata: a dict containing the raw data associated with each of the channels in this TDMS file. 


Mostly I think you will find it out by just trying it out on your favourite TDMS file and having a look at the data that the read procedure returns.




NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

What doesn't work yet is some of the data
