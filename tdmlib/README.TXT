Instructions for National Instruments DIAdem Connectivity Library Development Files

The DIAdem Connectivity Library enables applications to read and write TDM (.tdm) 
and TDM Streaming (.tdms) files. The TDM and TDM Streaming file formats are 
supported by National Instruments DIAdem.

See license.rtf for licensing terms and restrictions.

***************************************
*****  Development Instructions   *****
***************************************

The 'dev' directory contains the header file, import libraries, and binaries
to be used during development.  

Modify your compiler project or makefile settings to locate the header file 
and import library.

Import libraries are included in Microsoft (32-bit and 64-bit) and Borland (32-bit only)
formats. The Microsoft 32-bit format is compatible with Microsoft Visual C version 6.0 
or later. The Microsoft 64-bit format is compatible with Microsoft Visual C 8.0 or later.
The Borland format is compatible with Borland C/C++ version 5.02 or later and C++ Builder 
version 5.0 or later.

The 'dev\bin' directory contains separate sub-directories with the runtime components 
required for 32-bit and 64-bit applications. For the purpose of development testing, 
you should copy the contents of this directory into the same directory as your executable 
or DLL that uses this library.

Note that the runtime components for this library require the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 
runtime components version 8.0.50727.762 (or a later compatible version) to be installed. 
You must install 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) versions of the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 
runtime components depending on whether you are using this library in a 32-bit or 64-bit 
application.

The 'doc' directory includes a help file for the library.

The 'samples' directory contains sample programs.

***************************************
***** Redistribution Instructions *****
***************************************

The 'redist' directory contains 32-bit and 64-bit merge modules that include the 
runtime components required by the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of this library.

The 'niusiemb.msm' and 'niusiemb_x64.msm' merge modules contains all files in 
'dev\bin\32-bit' and 'dev\bin\64-bit', respectively, except for nilibddc.dll. The 
'nilibddc.msm' and 'nilibddc_x64.msm' merge modules contain only the 32-bit and 64-bit 
versions nilibddc.dll, respectively.

Your installed application will require the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 runtime components 
version 8.0.50727.762 (or a later compatible version). The 'Microsoft_VC80_CRT_x86.msm' 
and 'policy_8_0_Microsoft_VC80_CRT_x86.msm' merge modules will install the required 
components for 32-bit applications. The 'Microsoft_VC80_CRT_x86_x64.msm' and 'policy_8_0_Microsoft_VC80_CRT_x86_x64.msm' merge modules will install the required 
components for 64-bit applications.

The files in the included 'nilibddc[_x64]' and 'niusiemb[_x64].msm' merge modules need 
to be installed in the same directory as your executable or DLL that uses this library. 
It is highly recommended that this directory be specific to your application and not a 
shared system location like the Windows System directory. 

By default, the supplied 'nilibddc[_x64]' and 'niusiemb[_x64].msm' merge modules 
install their files to the directory specified by the INSTALLDIR installer property. 
Some installer authoring tools, including Wise for Windows Installer, set the INSTALLDIR 
property to the application directory selected by the user at install time. Other 
installer authoring tools do not use the INSTALLDIR property. For example, Microsoft 
Visual Studio uses the TARGETDIR property to store the application directory selected 
by the user at install time. If your installation directory for the files in the merge 
modules is specified by an installer property other than INSTALLDIR, then you must change 
the "Installation Directory" property of the merge modules to refer to the correct 
property name. See the documentation for your installer authoring tool for details.

These merge modules have been tested with Wise for Windows and Microsoft Visual Studio.
